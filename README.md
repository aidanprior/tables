# tables
A tables generator for camp


The program requires multiple csv files as data input:
    "Aides.tsv" : A single column row-list of aide names
    "Camper List.tsv" : A single column row-list of camper names by age (or cabin)
    "Counselor Tables.tsv" : A row-list of counselors at each table, with a seperate column for each counselor
                            Aide spots are designated with 'Aide'
                          
The program will generate a "Conflicts.csv" file if one does not yet exist, where each column will be a list of 
    campers and counselors with the same last name.
    These lists may be added to, removed from, or even new lists added to
  
If the "Conflicts.csv" file already exists, then the program will use those conflicts to generate the tables
    and save it in a "Tables-Week#.tsv" file  and a "Lookup-Week#.tsv" 
  
The program requires two positional commandline arguments, 'start Week' and 'end Week' (both integers)
    these only affect the resultant filenames. The program will create tables for each week between
    the two inclusive
